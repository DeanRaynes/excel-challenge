Crowdfunding Report

What are three conclusions we can draw from crowdfunding campaigns?
-	Majority of crowdfunding campaigns are successful.
-	Most crowdfunding campaigns are aimed are the Theater category.
-	The category with the most successful outcome is Technology.

What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	 Without having the data of how much individual backers contributed we can’t know the max and min contributed that could help us understand the data behind the backers count.
-	We don’t have any data on what was done around marketing of the campaign to tell us the HOW the campaign was ran.  This could help inform if the marketing of the campaign helps it be more successful.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
-	A graph with outcome based on average donation amount could tell us if the average donation amount helps a campaign succeed.
-	A graph with outcome based on goal amount could help us understand if the size of the crowdfunding goal is more successful if you are only asking for a small amount.
